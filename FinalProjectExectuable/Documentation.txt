Description of World
	- Crater world with river/body of water flowing around land
	- Nature scene with sheep, butterflies, and fish.

World Exploration:
	- First Person Controller
	- Top down camera
	- Camera that follows fish flock (path followers)
	- Camera that follows a single butterfly (flow followers)

Steering Behavior Description
	Flocking:
		- Fish in river flock together, they are following a path through the river searching for food.
		- Grazing animals on land wander and flock together.
	Path Following:
		- Fish are following a path through the river searching for food.
	Flow Field Following:	
		- Butterflies flying around looking for food (Mostly go from one side of the map to the other)
	Areas of Resistance:
		- There is a section on the fish' path where they move slower. (Marked by green rectangle in debug mode) 	
			They move slower in this area because the kelp is denser.

Other Notes
	- When the first person controller goes underwater, a fog is applied to the camera to give the look that the player
		is actually underwater. 
	- There are also sound effects imported. When user goes underwater, there are underwater sounds. When user goes near sheep flock, the sounds of sheep get louder. When 			the user goes near the water, sounds of water get louder. Also got sound effects for footsteps and edited some of them using Adobe Audition.
